# Scaling

In this exercise, you will be given a scenario where some kind of scaling will need to occur to meet demand.
Read through the scenario and give any pros and cons for **both vertical and horizontal** scaling that you can think of, giving examples as to how that specific feature of scaling would positively or negatively affect the infrastructure, the company, or the client.

For example;

### Horizontal Scaling:

    #### Pro
        Cost: This type of scaling can be cheap on demand for short periods of time.
        Load balancing: Traffic can be distributed among numerous instances 
        Failover: If an instance goes down, you could handle the traffic by diverting to healthy services instead
        Ease: It's simpler to scale horizontally with cloud providers, and you can also scale these down easily too

    #### Con
        Data Synchronisation; When dealing with this kind of scaling, it might be difficult to have consistent data across all instances to provide a consistent user experience.
        Latency: If your servers a geographically separated there's some level of latency introduced when traffic goes between them
       Complexity: The more boxes you are running on, the more logging you need, more visibility of these boxes and more analysis to determine if anything is going wrong

### Vertical Scaling

    #### Pros
        Performance: You can get immediate, fixed amounts of performance boost from ading resources to your server
        Ease: Theres only one machine to manage, one machine to have metrics, logging, analytics for etc
        Data: It's easier to manage your data in a single instance, than having to replicate across multiple boxes

    #### Cons
        Scale: You can only scale this so far, once you've hit peak capacity you have no breathing room. You need another box at that point.
        SPOF: If the one instance you have goes down, you have no fallback in place, your service will be down until you find the root cause and fix the issue
        Downtime: If you want to make any changes to this server, you will need to take it offline for a period of time, this isn't great if you need to boost your performance, as you'll be missing traffic at the point of a spike

## Scenario

An e-commerce website experiences a sudden surge in traffic due to a flash sale event. The website needs to handle the increased load efficiently to ensure smooth user experience and prevent downtime.

## Extension

What scaling decision would you choose and what steps do you think you might take to achieve the desired infrastructure?

I would choose to horizontally scale more instances of our server, this is quicker to spin up with no down time on the main server instance, and it's also easier to tear down if traffic ceases after the spike. If you were to vertically scale, you risk taking your instance down at peak time, losing traffic and sales, you would also need to scale this down in future when traffic spikes stop, causing another outage
